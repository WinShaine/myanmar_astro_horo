   - **Features**: Supports conversion to C#, .NET, and web technologies. Provides a high degree of automation, reducing manual coding efforts.

2. **gmStudio**
   - **Description**: An advanced migration tool for converting VB6 applications to modern .NET languages.
   - **Website**: [gmStudio](https://www.greatmigrations.com/)
   - **Features**: Allows detailed customization and scripting for migration, supports both automated and manual conversion processes.

3. **VB Migration Partner**
   - **Description**: Another tool for converting VB6 applications to .NET and other modern frameworks.
   - **Website**: [VB Migration Partner](https://www.vbmigration.com/)
   - **Features**: Provides a mix of automated and manual migration options, with support for complex VB6 features.

### Migration Process

#### Step 1: Assessment and Planning
1. **Analyze the VB6 Application**: Understand the scope, complexity, and dependencies of your VB6 application.
2. **Define Migration Goals**: Determine the target language (JavaScript, Python, etc.), frameworks, and platforms.
3. **Create a Migration Plan**: Outline the steps, tools, and resources needed for the migration.

#### Step 2: Setting Up Tools
1. **Install Migration Tools**: Download and install the necessary migration tools such as VBUC, gmStudio, or VB Migration Partner.
2. **Configure Tools**: Set up the tools according to the migration plan, specifying the source VB6 project and the target language/framework.

#### Step 3: Automated Migration
1. **Run Migration Tools**: Use the selected tool to perform an initial automated migration of the VB6 codebase.
2. **Review and Analyze Output**: Examine the converted code for accuracy, completeness, and any issues that need manual intervention.

#### Step 4: Manual Adjustments
1. **Resolve Migration Issues**: Manually fix any issues that were not handled by the automated tools.
2. **Refactor Code**: Optimize and refactor the converted code to align with modern coding standards and best practices.

#### Step 5: Testing and Validation
1. **Test the Migrated Application**: Perform thorough testing to ensure the functionality matches the original VB6 application.
2. **Fix Bugs**: Address any bugs or discrepancies identified during testing.

#### Step 6: Deployment
1. **Deploy the Application**: Deploy the migrated application to the target environment.
2. **Monitor and Support**: Monitor the application for any issues post-deployment and provide necessary support.
