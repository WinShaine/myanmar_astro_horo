## Example Feature Request

### Summary

Add a dark mode theme to the application.

### Problem Statement

Many users prefer a dark mode to reduce eye strain, especially in low-light environments.

### Proposed Solution

Implement a toggle switch in the settings menu to enable/disable dark mode. The dark mode theme should use darker colors for the background and lighter colors for text and other elements.

### Benefits

- Reduces eye strain for users in low-light environments.
- Provides a modern and customizable user experience.

### Alternatives Considered

- Using a browser extension for dark mode (not ideal as it does not integrate with the application's native settings).
- Manually adjusting screen brightness (not a complete solution).

### Additional Context
